"""Response schemas for the Attested Changesets read-only REST surface
(``GET /attestations``, ``GET /attestations/{id}``,
``GET /approvals/{id}/attestation`` — Task 19).

Field mapping is truthful to ``forge_db.models.attestation.Attestation``:
``changeset_hash`` is the row's ``subject_digest`` (the labeled sha256 of the
attested subject), ``keyid``/``predicate_type``/``payload_hash``/``created_at``
are the columns verbatim, and ``provenance`` carries the queryable provenance
columns the dashboard filters on. ``verified`` is **computed, never stored**:
the router runs the exact ``forge-verify --run`` verification seam
(:func:`forge_api.cli_verify.verify_stored_attestation` — PAE re-derivation +
Ed25519 over the envelope) against the deployment's verification key, so a
record this deployment cannot vouch for honestly reads ``verified: false``.

The raw DSSE ``envelope`` is deliberately not exposed here: independent
(offline) verification goes through ``forge-verify``, which re-reads the row —
the REST surface never becomes a second source of truth for the signature.
